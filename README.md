# Forex Pattern Mining with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Forex Pattern Mining project! In the dynamic world of foreign exchange (Forex) trading, data is the key to informed decision-making. Recognizing recurring patterns within Forex rate data is essential for predicting future trends and gaining valuable insights for investment decisions. However, traditional statistical methods often fall short in identifying complex patterns, leading to the rise of machine learning (ML) techniques as powerful tools in Forex analysis.

**Introduction**

In this study, we leverage ML techniques, including neural networks, support vector machines, regression models, and time series forecasting models, to uncover recurring patterns within Forex rate data. By harnessing the capacity of ML to capture intricate relationships and nonlinear patterns, our goal is to provide traders, investors, and financial institutions with a robust framework for pattern identification and forecasting in Forex markets.

**Objectives**

Our primary objective is to develop a comprehensive framework for identifying and analyzing recurring patterns in Forex rate data, specifically focusing on the KES/USD currency pair. Key objectives include:

- Utilizing ML techniques to detect complex patterns within Forex rate data.
- Evaluating the performance of various ML models based on key metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R^2, and EV.
- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in forecasting future trends and providing insights for decision-making.
  
**Methodology**

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
We gather historical Forex rate data for the KES/USD currency pair and preprocess it to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

2. Model Selection and Evaluation
We employ a range of ML techniques, including neural networks, support vector machines, regression models, and time series forecasting models, to identify recurring patterns within the data. Models are evaluated based on their performance metrics to determine the most effective approach.

3. Pattern Identification and Forecasting
Using the selected ML models, we identify recurring patterns within the Forex rate data and assess their predictive capabilities for forecasting future trends. Insights gleaned from these patterns aid in making informed decisions in Forex trading.

**Results**

Our experimental results showcase the effectiveness of ML techniques in identifying recurring patterns and forecasting trends within Forex rate data. By ranking the performance of various ML models based on key metrics, we provide traders, investors, and financial institutions with valuable tools for mitigating risks and making informed decisions in Forex trading.
